                “Lorem ipsum” dummy text is used by many web-developers to test how their HTML templates will look with real data. Often, developers use third-party services to generate “Lorem ipsum” text, but now you can do that right in your editor. Just expand lorem or lipsum abbreviations to get the following snippet:
              </p>
              <button>submit</button>
            </div>
